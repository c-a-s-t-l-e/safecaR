# safecaR: Access NHTSA Vehicle Safety Data from R <img src="man/figures/safecaR_hex_logo.png" style="float:right; width:120px; margin-left:10px;"/>

## Overview

The `safecaR` R package provides a tidy interface to **NHTSA APIs**, including crash ratings, recalls, and complaints.

⚠️ **Note:** This package requires an internet connection to fetch data from public NHTSA APIs. If you're offline, functions will not return results.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of `safecaR` on Github with the following:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes") if you don't have it
remotes::install_github("c-a-s-t-l-e/safecaR")

# or via CRAN
install.packages("safecaR")
```
